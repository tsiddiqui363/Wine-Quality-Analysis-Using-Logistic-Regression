# Wine-Quality-Analysis-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project focuses on predicting wine quality using logistic regression models. I employed various data transformations and feature selection techniques to optimize model performance.

Data Preprocessing:

Dataset Used: Wine Dataset.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
Data Transformation: Logarithmic, square root, exponential, power, and Box-Cox transformations to address skewness.
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler for normalizing features.


Model Building:

Algorithm: Logistic Regression.
Evaluation: Accuracy score used for model performance evaluation.
Transformation Impact: Analyzing the impact of different transformations on model accuracy.


Insights:

Feature Importance: Exploring the significance of various features in predicting wine quality.
Model Accuracy: Comparison of model performance with different preprocessing techniques.


Conclusions:

Discussion on the balance between feature selection, data transformation, and their impact on model accuracy.
